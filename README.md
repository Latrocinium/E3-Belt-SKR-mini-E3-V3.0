# E3-Belt-SKR-mini-E3-V3.0
Klipper config for E3 Belt Kit w SKR mini E3 V3.0

This is the file I was able to cobble together from a couple of different sources. mainly
config/generic-bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v3.0.cfg
https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3/blob/master/hardware/BTT%20SKR%20MINI%20E3%20V3.0/Hardware/BTT%20E3%20SKR%20MINI%20V3.0_PIN.pdf
and
https://github.com/akslick/Klipper-Belt-E3-config/blob/main/printer.cfg

E-Steps/rotation distance was way off so this config has been adjusted accordingly to get everything preliminarily working correctly
Tested on my E3 Belt w SKR mini 3 v3.0
